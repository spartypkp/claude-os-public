"""Custom Applications - Generated from APP-SPEC.md blueprints.

Custom Apps are self-contained feature domains that extend Claude OS.
Each app contains its own tools, schemas, and configuration.
They follow the same AppPlugin interface as Core Apps.

Note: Custom apps only load if matching Desktop/*/APP-SPEC.md exists.
