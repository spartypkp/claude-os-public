# Calendar Configuration (Direct-Read Apple Calendar)
#
# This config mirrors email's pattern:
# - Data-plane reads come from Apple Calendar SQLite (read-only)
# - Account-specific config (aliases, preferred_calendars, defaults) lives in accounts.yaml
# - This file contains only global calendar settings

# Preferred calendars - filter out junk/noise calendars
# These are shown in UI and returned by MCP tools
preferred_calendars:
  - "Personal"
  - "Calendar"
  - "Work"
  - "Home"

# Calendar aliases - friendly names for calendars
aliases:
  exchange: "Calendar"
  personal: "Calendar"
  gmail: "Personal"
  work: "Work"

# Permissions - which calendars Claude can modify
# These should match what the user is comfortable with Claude changing autonomously
permissions:
  can_create:
    - "Personal"
    - "Calendar"
    - "Work"
  can_delete: []  # Empty = require human confirmation for all deletes

# Read settings
read:
  include_all_day_events: true
  timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"

# Tool metadata - used by watcher to populate SYSTEM-INDEX.md
